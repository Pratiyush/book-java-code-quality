# FLAG — key 45 — jqwik cited in prose but realized prose-only in the companion build

- **Severity:** minor (companion-build scope / tool-vitality; not a fact error — jqwik IS pinned).
- **Context:** key 45 ("The Database That Does Not Exist in Production") presents **jqwik** as the chapter's
  named Java property-based-testing library: `@Property` + `@ForAll`, `Arbitraries`/`@Provide`, shrinking
  to a minimal counterexample, its own `TestEngine` on the JUnit Platform. jqwik **is** a `SOURCE-PIN.md`
  §3 row (**1.10.1**, recorded there as `⚠ maintenance mode`).
- **Decision taken at EXAMPLE-BUILD (Step 4b):** the companion module `08-companion-code/45_integration_property_based_testing/`
  does **NOT** add `net.jqwik:jqwik` to its build. Two reasons, both recorded in the module pom and README:
  1. jqwik is **not managed by the aggregator BOM**, and SOURCE-PIN records it as **maintenance mode**
     (the chapter's own tool-vitality caveat) — a heavy commitment to weigh, not a default add.
  2. The chapter's two teaching ideas — **generated inputs** and **shrinking to a minimal counterexample** —
     are realized runnably with the already-pinned stack only: a seeded `java.util.random.RandomGenerator`
     feeding a JUnit `@ParameterizedTest` body (`SkuPropertyTest`), plus a small JDK `Shrinker` that reduces a
     found failure to its minimal counterexample. The build is green with no extra dependency.
- **What is asserted vs. what is built:** every *factual* claim about jqwik in the PROSE (its annotations,
  shrinking behaviour, TestEngine integration, maintenance-mode status) traces to jqwik's own docs at the
  pin and stays in the prose. The CODE realizes the technique, not the library. The prose lead-ins around the
  property snippets state this honestly ("the module builds without a dedicated property library on its
  classpath, so it realizes the technique with a seeded JDK generator … jqwik is the prose's named Java
  realization").
- **Required action (human/editorial):** confirm this is the intended scope — present jqwik as the named
  library (cited, crown-none, maintenance-mode caveat intact) while the runnable artifact uses the pinned
  JDK-only realization. If a future decision wants jqwik compiled, add it as an explicit test-scope
  dependency at the SOURCE-PIN version (1.10.1) and re-run FLOOR C.
- **Status:** OPEN — scope decision for the human gate. No fact error; no NEUTRALITY breach; build is green.

**Marker-resolution update (2026-06-27, source-verifier).** The deferred-verification markers in
`03-drafts/45_integration_property_based_testing/45_integration_property_based_testing_v1.md` were resolved
against (a) SOURCE-PIN.md (corrected 2026-06-27) and (b) the BUILT module:
- **Confirmed + un-marked in the draft:** jqwik **1.10.1** version and **maintenance-mode** status both trace
  to SOURCE-PIN §3 (recorded there as `⚠ maintenance mode`); GAV `net.jqwik:jqwik` recorded; the JUnit
  param-source annotations the build actually exercises (`@ParameterizedTest`/`@ValueSource`/`@CsvSource`/
  `@MethodSource`) compile green under JUnit 6 (BOM 6.0.3) in the module.
- **Left marked `⚠ @pin` in the draft (genuinely unverified here):** jqwik default `@Property` tries count,
  the `Arbitraries`/`@Provide` API surface, and `@EnumSource`/`@ArgumentsSource` — these are prose-only
  jqwik-doc atoms, NOT in SOURCE-PIN and NOT exercised by the build; they need jqwik's pinned docs fetched.
- This flag stays **OPEN** as the underlying cited-not-built scope decision for the human gate; the build
  remains green and jqwik is realized prose-only with a seeded JDK generator + JDK shrinker.

**⚠ @pin TOOL-DOC ATOMS — RESOLVED (2026-06-28, WEB-VERIFY).** The jqwik `⚠ @pin` atom capping ACCURACY on
printed Ch 22 is now web-verified against the pinned docs and resolved in the draft; `⚠ @pin` marker removed.
The cited-not-built **scope decision** above remains OPEN for the human gate.
- **jqwik default `@Property` tries = 1000 — VERIFIED.** jqwik user guide
  (`jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html`, version 1.10.1): "If not specified differently, jqwik will run
  1000 tries … and execute the property method with each of those parameter sets"; overridable via the
  `tries` attribute or globally. The draft body now states "by default 1,000 tries per property (the `tries`
  attribute, overridable per property or globally)"; back-matter cite + URL added.
- **`Arbitraries`/`@Provide` — VERIFIED** as the documented generator-description API at the same user guide
  (named in prose, not load-bearing as a signature). GAV `net.jqwik:jqwik:1.10.1` resolves on Maven Central
  (HTTP 200). jqwik maintenance-mode (2026) unchanged (already verified vs SOURCE-PIN §3).
- **Residual (NOT a capping atom):** `@EnumSource`/`@ArgumentsSource` (JUnit Jupiter, named-not-exercised by
  the build) remain a low-load-bearing `⚠ verify-at-pin` note in the header ledger; not part of the 4 capping
  atoms and not blocking ACCURACY.
